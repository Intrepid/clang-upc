/**
 * @file gupcr_shutdown.c
 * GUPC Portals4 shutdown support.
 *
 * Support for upc_global_exit ().
 *
 * Each UPC thread (process) creates a helper (shutdown) pthread
 * with the sole purpose of waiting for receipt of a remote request
 * to shutdown, as a result of the other thread issuing a call
 * to upc_global_exit.
 *
 * This pthread uses a special PTE/LE (GUPCR_PTL_PTE_SHUTDOWN) to receive a
 * global exit code from another UPC thread.  A simple PtlPut of the
 * exit code issued to the shutdown PTE on some other UPC thread
 * triggers exit of the receiving thread.
 *
 * The following steps are taken to initialize, wait, and signal
 * the UPC global exit:
 *
 * - Each thread initializes a PTE/LE to receive an exit code that
 *     was passed in as the argument to upc_global_exit().
 * - Each thread creates a helper pthread - gupcr_shutdown_pthread()
 *     that waits on the shutdown LE's counting event (one count only).
 * - The main UPC thread installs a signal handler for SHUTDWON_SIGNAL
 *     that is used by the shutdown pthread to signal a need for
 *     global exit.
 * - Remote shutdown takes the following steps:
 *     -# A UPC thread executing a call to upc_global_exit() sends the
 *        exit code to all other UPC threads by using the shutdown PTE.
 *     -# The pthread associated with each UPC thread receives the
 *        exit code and returns from the counting event Portals
 *        wait call.
 *     -# The receiving pthread sends the SHUTDOWN_SIGNAL to the main
 *     	  UPC thread and calls pthread_exit().
 *     -# The main UPC thread receives the signal, which invokes
 *        the signal handler.
 *     -# The signal handler waits for the shutdown pthread to exit,
 *        and then calls exit() with the code received from
 *        the thread that sent the shutdown request.  The invoking thread
 *        also waits for ACKs from the first step with the configured timeout,
 *
 *  @note
 *  -# The gupcr_exit() function is registered with atexit()
 *     and will be executed when exit() is called.
 *  -# Upon regular exit, the main UPC thread disables the
 *     SHUTDOWN_SIGNAL signal, and terminates the shutdown pthread
 *     by writing a dummy value using its own shutdown PTE.
