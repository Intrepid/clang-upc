/* UPC lock implementation.

   The UPC lock functions use MCS locks as described in the
   Mellor-Crummey and Scott paper: "Algorithms for Scalable Synchronization
   on Shared-Memory Multiprocessors", ACM Transaction on Computer Systems,
   February 1991.

   The following data structures are used in this implementation:

   * Lock link block
     A data structure in the shared address space used to link threads
     waiting on the lock.  Each thread inserts itself on the list with
     a link block that but has affinity to the thread itself. It has
     three fields: (1) next - link list pointer, (2) signal - notification
     of lock ownership transfer, (3) free flag - link block was freed by
     some other thread. A link block has affinity to the owner of the block.
   * Lock Link block reference
     A 64 bits container for pointer to shared that contains only a thread
     number and address field.  Link reference allow the lock routines to
     efficiently execute atomic operations on shared pointers.
   * Lock structure (upc_lock_t)
     A lock is a data structure living in the shared memory space.
     Contains two lock link references: (1) last - a lock link reference
     to the link block of the last thread on the lock waiting list,
     (2) owner - link reference to the lock's owner link block. The lock
     data structure has affinity of the thread that created the lock.

   The lock data structure goes though the following states:

   * Lock is free
     Last link block reference is NULL.
   * Lock is taken
     Last link block reference points to the last thread's link block on
     the waiting queue.  Owner link reference points to the owner thread's
     link block.  Only the owner of the lock is allowed to manipulate the
     owner's link reference in the lock data structure.

   The following operations are performed on the lock data structure:

   * Lock acquire
     Thread allocates a link block and write its reference to the 'last'
     filed of the lock data structure by performing an atomic SWAP
     operation.  If returned value is NULL, thread is the owner of the
     lock.  Otherwise a link reference to the last thread on the waiting
     queue is returned and thread needs to link itself on the waiting
     queue.
   * Lock release
     Attempt to write a NULL link block reference into the lock's 'last'
     field with atomic CSWAP operation.  If successful, lock is released.
     Otherwise, the ownership of the lock must be passed to the first
     thread on the wait queue.
   * Lock allocation/free
     Lock is allocated from the shared memory space or from the local
     free list.  They are freed by placing the lock data structure on
     the local lock free list if the lock has affinity of the thread that
     releases it.  Otherwise lock's memory is released.
