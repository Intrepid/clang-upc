/*
 * UPC barrier implementation support routines.
 *
 * The UPC barrier synchronization statements are:
 *  - upc_notify <i>expression</i>
 *  - upc_wait <i>expression</i>
 *  - upc_barrier <i>expression</i>
 *
 * The upc barrier statement is equivalent to the compound statement:
 *   <i>{ upc_notify barrier_value; upc_wait barrier_value; }</i>
 *
 * The UPC runtime implementation of the barrier organizes the UPC
 * threads in a form of a tree with a configurable tree fanout.  Each
 * thread uses the following data structures:
 *
 * * A shared array of barrier block structures. Each thread has the
 *   barrier block structure consisting of the following variables:
 *   - notify    - Atomically incremented by the thread and its children
 *               whenever they arrive on the notify statement.  Once all
 *		 of them arrive, the parent of the thread is notified.
 *   - wait      - Signaling field for parent to inform children that they
 *		 are allowed to proceed from the wait phase.
 *   - id[2]     - Barrier ID that thread is waiting on. There are two
 *               barrier IDs to distinguish the correct notify/barrier
 *               sequence (a thread can be in a notify phase while children
 *               are still in the previous barrier wait state and need the
 *		 parent's barrier ID to compare against their own).
 * * A local array of threads' notify counts required to complete the notify
 *   phase (as we use atomic fetch and add function the required number of
 *   of notifications is equal to the children count).
 *
 * BARRIER NOTIFY
 *
 *  * Each leaf thread atomically increments the 'notify' field of the parent's
 *    barrier block.  Others atomically increment the same filed in their own
 *    barrier block.  The number of notifies before increment is returned back.
 *  * If number of notifies is equal to the thread's notify count the parent
 *    of the thread must be notified.  This propagates notification to the
 *    top of the tree (no thread waits for anyone in the notify phase).  Before
 *    parent is notified, the MAX barrier ID of the thread and its children
 *    is calculated and set as the effective thread's barrier ID.  At the
 *    end, the root thread has the MAX calculated ID for all threads.
 *  * The last thread notifying the root thread is also responsible for
 *    releasing the root thread from the wait.
 *
 * BARRIER WAIT
 *
 *  * Each parent (or another thread on behalf of the parent) atomically
 *    increments the 'wait' filed of its children (all threads completed
 *    the notify phase)..
 *  * Each thread also atomically increments the 'wait' field in its own
 *    barrier block (thread arrived on the wait statement).
 *  * Whoever incremented the filed first is responsible for further
 *    releasing thread's children. This makes sure that all children of a
 *    thread that has not arrived on the wait statement are allowed
 *    to complete their wait statements (split phase barrier).
 *
 * Current limitations:
 *   - Recursive behavior in the notify and wait statements can lead into
 *     more work for some of the threads.
